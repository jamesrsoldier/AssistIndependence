    <!-- Why We Started -->

          <div class="prose">

            <h2>Why We Started AssistIndependence</h2>
            <p>Like many families, ours had to navigate the confusing world of aging-in-place products when our parents started needing a little extra help around the house. What should have been straightforward became overwhelming. Every search led to pages of products with conflicting reviews, vague descriptions, and no clear way to know what would actually work.</p>
            <p>We found ourselves asking: Which grab bar is actually sturdy enough to trust? Does this shower chair really fit in a standard tub? Will this rollator last more than a few months? The answers were buried in hundreds of Amazon reviews that we had to read one by one.</p>
            <p>That experience planted a seed. What if there was a site that did this research for you? Not a site with sponsored picks or a single reviewer's opinion, but one that analyzed what thousands of real buyers said about products they actually used in their own homes.</p>
            <p>That is how AssistIndependence was born. We wanted to create the resource we wished we had found ourselves &mdash; one that cuts through the noise and helps families make confident decisions about products that genuinely matter.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At AssistIndependence, our mission is simple: help older adults and their families find the best aging-in-place products so they can continue living at home with confidence.</p>
            <p>We know that navigating home safety products can feel overwhelming. There are thousands of options, conflicting reviews, and no shortage of sites that feel more like sales pitches than genuine help. That is exactly why we exist. We are not a medical provider, and we are not here to push products on you. We are a trusted, warm guide &mdash; here to help you sort through the noise so you can make decisions that feel right for your home and your family.</p>

            <h2>How We Are Different</h2>
            <p>Most product review sites send a team to test a handful of items and call it a day. We take a fundamentally different approach.</p>
            <p>Instead of relying on one person's opinion, we analyze hundreds or thousands of verified reviews from people who actually use these products every day. By studying what large groups of verified purchasers consistently praise and consistently warn about, we can identify patterns that individual testing simply cannot reveal.</p>
            <p>We call this our <strong>real-reviews methodology</strong>. The result is recommendations grounded in lived experience, not a single test in a lab.</p>
            <p>We have no sponsored picks. No manufacturer pays to be featured. Our site is supported through affiliate partnerships, which means if you purchase a product through one of our links, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This keeps our recommendations honest and our content free.</p>
            <p>Want to learn more? Read our <a href="/how-we-rate/">full methodology page</a> to see exactly how we select and evaluate products.</p>

            <h2>Who We Write For</h2>
            <p>We write for two groups of people who share the same goal: making home a place where independence thrives.</p>

            <div class="callout-box" style="margin:var(--sp-6) 0;">
              <h3 style="margin-bottom:var(--sp-2);">Adult Caregivers (Ages 45&ndash;65)</h3>
              <p class="card-text">You may be researching products for a parent, in-law, or loved one. You want practical, trustworthy guidance without feeling like you are being sold to. You are juggling a lot, and you deserve a resource that respects your time and your intelligence. We are here to make your research easier and your decisions clearer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="callout-box" style="margin:var(--sp-6) 0;">
              <h3 style="margin-bottom:var(--sp-2);">Older Adults (Ages 65&ndash;80)</h3>
              <p class="card-text">You value your independence and want to stay in the home you love for as long as possible. You are looking for products that genuinely help without making you feel like you have lost control. We write for you with the warmth and respect you deserve, because your comfort and dignity matter deeply to us.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>

            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <p>Every product we recommend is chosen because it empowers people to do more on their own, not less. The right grab bar, the right walker, the right kitchen tool &mdash; these are not signs of giving up. They are tools for living fully.</p>

            <h3>Dignity</h3>
            <p>Language matters. You will never see patronizing or clinical language on our site. We write with warmth and respect because the people we serve deserve nothing less. Everyone who visits this site is a capable adult making smart decisions for themselves or someone they love.</p>

            <h3>Trust</h3>
            <p>We recommend what we would want for our own families. Period. Every product on this site earned its place through the collective voice of real buyers, not because a company paid us to feature it. If we would not trust it for our own parents, it does not make the cut.</p>

            <h3>Honesty</h3>
            <p>We are transparent about how we operate. Our site is supported by affiliate commissions, which means we earn a small percentage when you buy through our links. This never influences which products we recommend or how we rank them. Our editorial decisions are made independently, and we disclose our affiliate relationships clearly on every page.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
            <p>We are committed to making this site accessible, useful, and honest. That means:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Building pages that work well for people of all abilities</li>
              <li>Writing content that is clear and easy to read</li>
              <li>Always putting the reader first</li>
              <li>Being upfront about how we make money</li>
              <li>Never recommending products we would not trust for our own families</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If something on our site is not working for you, we want to know about it. We do not have all the answers, and we are not a substitute for professional medical or occupational therapy advice. But we are proud to be a starting point &mdash; a place where you can feel confident that the information you are reading is grounded in real experience and presented with genuine care.</p>

            <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
            <p>We would love to hear from you. Whether you have a suggestion, need help finding a product, or just want to say hello, our door is always open.</p>
