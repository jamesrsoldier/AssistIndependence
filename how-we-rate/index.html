            <h2>Our Philosophy: Real Reviews from Real People</h2>
            <p>Most product review sites send a team to test a handful of items and call it a day. We take a fundamentally different approach. Instead of relying on one person's opinion, we analyze hundreds or thousands of verified reviews from people who actually use these products every day.</p>
            <p>Why? Because a single reviewer cannot capture what it is like to use a grab bar for six months, or how a shower chair holds up after hundreds of uses, or whether a rollator's brakes still work smoothly after a year of daily walks. Real buyers tell us these things in their reviews.</p>
            <p>By studying what large groups of verified purchasers consistently praise and consistently warn about, we can identify patterns that individual testing simply cannot reveal. This is the foundation of everything we recommend.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: How We Select Products to Review</h2>
            <p>We focus on products that meet three criteria:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Available through major retailers:</strong> We primarily feature products available on Amazon and other established retailers. This ensures you can easily purchase what we recommend and benefit from standard return policies.</li>
              <li><strong>Sufficient review volume:</strong> A product needs at least 100 verified customer reviews before we consider it. For our "Top Pick" selections, we typically look at products with 500+ reviews so we can spot meaningful patterns.</li>
              <li><strong>Relevant to aging-in-place needs:</strong> We focus specifically on products that help people live safely and independently at home. This includes bathroom safety equipment, mobility aids, bedroom comfort products, kitchen tools, smart home devices, and daily living aids.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not review every product in a category. Instead, we focus on the products that real buyers are actually purchasing and reviewing in significant numbers.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: How We Analyze Customer Reviews</h2>
            <p>Once we have identified products with sufficient reviews, we look for patterns across the feedback:</p>

            <h3>What We Look For</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Overall rating trends:</strong> We note the average star rating, but we also look at the distribution. A product with 4.5 stars and a steady rating over time is more reliable than one with wild swings.</li>
              <li><strong>Recurring praise:</strong> When dozens or hundreds of reviewers mention the same positive feature, that is a meaningful signal. We highlight these consistent strengths in our write-ups.</li>
              <li><strong>Recurring complaints:</strong> Equally important, we look for patterns in negative feedback. If many reviewers mention the same durability issue or design flaw, we note it as a limitation.</li>
              <li><strong>Verified purchase status:</strong> We weight verified purchase reviews more heavily than unverified ones.</li>
              <li><strong>Review recency:</strong> Recent reviews (within the past 12-18 months) get more weight than older ones, since product quality and manufacturing can change over time.</li>
              <li><strong>Long-term use feedback:</strong> We specifically seek out reviews from people who have used a product for months or years, as these reveal durability and real-world performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What We Ignore</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Manufacturer claims:</strong> We base our assessments on what buyers say, not what brands say about their own products.</li>
              <li><strong>Single outlier reviews:</strong> One extremely positive or negative review does not define a product. We look for patterns across many reviews.</li>
              <li><strong>Reviews about shipping or packaging:</strong> These reflect the retailer, not the product itself.</li>
              <li><strong>Incentivized reviews:</strong> When reviewers disclose receiving a product for free, we note this and weight their feedback accordingly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 3: How We Determine "Top Rated" and "Top Pick" Status</h2>
            <p>A product earns featured status on our site when it meets all of the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Consistently high ratings:</strong> The product maintains an average of 4.3 stars or higher across hundreds of verified reviews.</li>
              <li><strong>Strong performance in key areas:</strong> For each category, there are specific things that matter most. For grab bars, that is weight capacity and mounting security. For shower chairs, it is stability and comfort. We look at whether reviewers consistently praise the product in these key areas.</li>
              <li><strong>Minimal safety concerns:</strong> Any recurring complaints about safety or structural issues disqualify a product from our top recommendations, regardless of overall rating.</li>
              <li><strong>Good value:</strong> The product delivers quality appropriate to its price point. An expensive product should outperform a budget option; a budget product should deliver solid basics without cutting corners on safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 4: How We Present Our Findings</h2>
            <p>For each product we recommend, we provide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The aggregated rating:</strong> The overall star rating based on verified reviews.</li>
              <li><strong>Review count:</strong> How many reviews our assessment is based on.</li>
              <li><strong>Key strengths:</strong> The features and qualities that reviewers consistently praise.</li>
              <li><strong>Honest limitations:</strong> Issues or drawbacks that reviewers commonly mention. We believe you deserve to know both sides.</li>
              <li><strong>Who it is best for:</strong> The type of user or situation where this product excels.</li>
              <li><strong>Price range:</strong> Current pricing so you can factor cost into your decision.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What We Will Never Do</h2>
            <p>To maintain the integrity of our recommendations, we commit to the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>We never accept payment for product placements.</strong> Manufacturers cannot pay to be featured, to receive a higher ranking, or to avoid negative mentions.</li>
              <li><strong>We never accept free products in exchange for reviews.</strong> Our assessments are based on what paying customers experience.</li>
              <li><strong>We never let affiliate relationships influence rankings.</strong> While we earn commissions when you purchase through our links, we recommend products based solely on customer feedback. A product with a higher commission rate gets no special treatment.</li>
              <li><strong>We never hide limitations.</strong> If reviewers consistently mention a problem, we mention it too.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
            <p>AssistIndependence is supported through affiliate partnerships. When you click a product link on our site and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission from the retailer. This costs you nothing extra and allows us to keep our content free.</p>
            <p>Importantly, affiliate commissions never influence which products we recommend or how we rank them. A product that pays a 2% commission is evaluated exactly the same as one that pays 8%. Our only criterion is what serves our readers best.</p>
            <p>For complete details, see our <a href="/affiliate-disclosure/">Affiliate Disclosure</a>.</p>

            <h2>How Often We Update</h2>
            <p>We review and refresh our recommendations quarterly. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Re-checking review counts and ratings</li>
              <li>Looking for new products that have gained traction</li>
              <li>Removing products that are discontinued or have dropped in quality</li>
              <li>Updating pricing information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each page on our site displays a "Last updated" date so you know how current our information is.</p>
