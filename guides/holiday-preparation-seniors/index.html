            <p>Holiday visits with aging parents are precious opportunities to spend quality time together. But when you have not seen your parents in a while, you might notice changes in their mobility, balance, or energy levels. A home that works perfectly for you might present unexpected challenges for someone who moves a little slower, sees a little less clearly, or tires more easily than they used to.</p>

            <p>The good news is that preparing your home does not require major renovations or making your guest room look like a medical facility. Small, thoughtful adjustments can make a significant difference in safety and comfort. This guide walks you through everything you need to consider, from a quick safety walkthrough before they arrive to having the right products on hand for common situations.</p>

            <!-- Quick Safety Assessment -->
            <h2 id="safety-assessment">Quick Safety Assessment Before They Arrive</h2>

            <p>A few days before your parents arrive, walk through your home with fresh eyes. Try to notice things you have become accustomed to that might pose challenges for someone less familiar with your space.</p>

            <p><strong>Start with lighting.</strong> Walk the path from the front door to the guest bedroom, then to the bathroom, and finally to the kitchen. Do this during the day with curtains closed, then again at night. Are there any dark spots where someone might misstep? Pay special attention to hallways, stairways, and the area around the bathroom door. Night lights are inexpensive and can prevent a middle-of-the-night stumble.</p>

            <p><strong>Check for tripping hazards.</strong> Look down as you walk each path. Loose area rugs, electrical cords running across walkways, low furniture, pet toys, and raised thresholds between rooms can all cause falls. Either remove these hazards temporarily or mark them clearly. A piece of brightly colored tape on a raised threshold can make it visible even in dim light.</p>

            <p><strong>Test your handrails.</strong> If you have stairs, check that the handrails are secure. Give them a firm tug. If they wobble, tighten the mounting hardware before your guests arrive. Consider adding a rail to any steps that currently lack one, including the steps leading to your front door.</p>

            <p><strong>Clear clutter from common areas.</strong> A stack of books by the couch, shoes by the door, or boxes in the hallway might be fine for you, but they can be obstacles for someone with limited mobility or vision. Create wide, clear pathways through every room your parents will use.</p>

            <!-- Temporary Modifications -->
            <h2 id="temporary-modifications">Temporary Modifications That Make a Difference</h2>

            <p>You do not need to remodel your home to make it safer. Many helpful modifications are temporary and can be set up before the visit and removed afterward if you prefer.</p>

            <p><strong>Non-slip mats</strong> are one of the most versatile tools you can have. Place them at every transition between surfaces: inside the front door, outside the bathroom, beside the bed, and at the bottom and top of stairs. Look for mats with rubber backing that grip the floor firmly. Avoid fluffy rugs that can bunch up underfoot.</p>

            <p><strong>Temporary grab bars</strong> can be installed in the bathroom without drilling holes in your walls. Suction-cup grab bars work well on smooth tile or fiberglass surfaces. Clamp-on tub rails attach to the side of the bathtub and provide a sturdy handhold for getting in and out. Test any suction-cup product thoroughly before relying on it for support.</p>

            <p><strong>Motion-sensor lights</strong> plug into standard outlets and turn on automatically when someone walks by. Place them in the hallway outside the guest room, in the bathroom, and along the path to the kitchen. This way, your parents will not have to fumble for light switches in an unfamiliar home during the night.</p>

            <p><strong>A bedside commode</strong> might be worth considering if your guest bathroom is far from the bedroom or requires navigating stairs. While it may seem like an awkward addition, for some seniors it provides peace of mind and reduces the risk of nighttime falls. If a commode feels like too much, at minimum ensure there is a clear, well-lit path to the nearest bathroom.</p>

            <!-- Bedroom and Bathroom Prep -->
            <h2 id="bedroom-bathroom">Bedroom and Bathroom Prep</h2>

            <p>The bedroom and bathroom are where your parents will spend quiet time alone, often when they are most tired. These rooms deserve special attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Bed height matters.</strong> A bed that is too low makes standing up difficult. A bed that is too high can be hard to climb into. Ideally, when your parent sits on the edge of the bed, their feet should rest flat on the floor with knees bent at about 90 degrees. Bed risers can add a few inches of height if needed. If the bed is too high, you might temporarily switch to a lower mattress or remove the bed frame.</p>

            <p><strong>Keep essentials within reach.</strong> Set up a nightstand with a lamp that is easy to turn on, a glass of water, any medications they might need during the night, their phone, and reading glasses. Consider a lamp with a touch-sensitive base or a large, easy-to-find switch rather than a small toggle that requires fine motor control in the dark.</p>

            <p><strong>In the bathroom, prioritize the toilet area first.</strong> A <a href="/bathroom-safety/raised-toilet-seats/">raised toilet seat</a> reduces how far your parent needs to lower themselves and makes standing back up much easier. Many models install in seconds without tools. Pair it with a toilet safety frame or grab bars for additional support. See our <a href="/guides/bathroom-safety-checklist/">complete bathroom safety checklist</a> for a thorough walkthrough.</p>

            <p><strong>The shower or tub is the second priority.</strong> A <a href="/bathroom-safety/shower-chairs/">shower chair</a> allows your parent to bathe safely while seated. A handheld showerhead makes rinsing easier from a seated position. <a href="/bathroom-safety/non-slip-mats/">Non-slip mats</a> inside and outside the tub are essential. If stepping over the tub wall is a challenge, consider a transfer bench that bridges the gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Stock the bathroom with practical items:</strong> a non-slip bath mat outside the shower, extra towels within easy reach, good lighting, and a nightlight that stays on after dark.</p>

            <!-- Kitchen and Dining -->
            <h2 id="kitchen-dining">Kitchen and Dining Accessibility</h2>

            <p>Holiday gatherings often center around food, which means your parents will likely spend time in the kitchen and dining areas. A few adjustments can make these spaces more comfortable.</p>

            <p><strong>Provide sturdy seating.</strong> Make sure there are chairs with arms that your parent can use to push themselves up when standing. Avoid stools, benches, or chairs with wheels. If your dining chairs lack arms, consider borrowing or purchasing one sturdy armchair for the table.</p>

            <p><strong>Clear pathways between the kitchen and dining areas.</strong> During holiday cooking, kitchens can become cluttered with bags, boxes, and extra dishes. Keep main walkways clear so someone using a cane or walker can move through safely.</p>

            <p><strong>Adjust counter accessibility.</strong> If your parent wants to help with cooking, think about which tasks can be done while seated. A cutting board, mixing bowl, or vegetable prep can easily move to the dining table where they can sit comfortably. This keeps them involved without requiring long periods of standing.</p>

            <p><strong>Check your flooring.</strong> Kitchen spills happen during holiday cooking. Keep a mop or towels handy to clean up any wet spots immediately. A small spill that would not bother you could be dangerous for someone less steady on their feet.</p>

            <p><strong>Make frequently used items accessible.</strong> If your parent will be helping themselves to snacks, drinks, or medications, make sure these items are stored at a height they can reach without stretching or bending deeply. Explore our <a href="/kitchen/">kitchen accessibility products</a> for helpful tools.</p>

            <!-- Managing Medications -->
            <h2 id="medications">Managing Medications During Visits</h2>

            <p>Medication management is one of the most important but often overlooked aspects of hosting aging parents. A disrupted routine, different time zones, or simply the excitement of the holiday can lead to missed doses or double doses.</p>

            <p><strong>Ask your parent to bring all medications in original containers</strong> along with a written list of what they take and when. This information is invaluable if there is a medical emergency or if you need to consult a local pharmacy.</p>

            <p><strong>Set up a dedicated medication area.</strong> A specific spot in the kitchen or guest room where medications stay organized helps maintain routine. Keep this area away from food preparation surfaces and out of reach of children or pets.</p>

            <p><strong>Use a pill organizer.</strong> A weekly pill organizer with compartments for morning, afternoon, and evening doses makes it easy to see at a glance whether medications have been taken. Your parent may already use one at home; if not, this could be a thoughtful gift.</p>

            <p><strong>Set phone alarms.</strong> If your parent takes medications at specific times, help them set alarms on their phone. If they are not comfortable with phone technology, set alarms on your own phone and check in with them at those times.</p>

            <p><strong>Know their emergency contacts.</strong> Have the phone numbers for their primary doctor, specialists, and home pharmacy saved in your phone. If something goes wrong, you will not have to search for this information.</p>

            <!-- Sensitive Conversations -->
            <h2 id="conversations">Conversation Starters: Approaching Sensitive Topics</h2>

            <p>Holiday visits often reveal changes in our parents that we did not notice during phone calls or video chats. You might observe difficulty walking, confusion, forgetfulness, or signs that they are struggling with daily tasks. Addressing these observations requires sensitivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Lead with curiosity, not concern.</strong> Instead of saying "I'm worried about you," try "How have things been going at home lately?" or "How are you finding the stairs these days?" Open-ended questions invite conversation rather than defensive responses.</p>

            <p><strong>Focus on environment, not ability.</strong> Frame suggestions around making their home work better, not around their declining abilities. "Have you thought about adding a grab bar in the bathroom? I just installed one and it's surprisingly useful" feels different from "You need a grab bar because you're unsteady."</p>

            <p><strong>Choose the right moment.</strong> Sensitive conversations are best held one-on-one, in a calm moment, not in front of other family members or during the stress of holiday preparations. A quiet walk, a cup of coffee, or a drive in the car can provide good opportunities.</p>

            <p><strong>Listen more than you talk.</strong> Your parents may be aware of changes you have noticed and may already have concerns or plans you do not know about. Give them space to share their perspective before offering solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Follow up after the visit.</strong> One conversation rarely resolves everything. Let your parents know you are available to continue discussing any concerns. A phone call a week after the visit can be a good time to check in on any topics you raised.</p>

            <!-- Products to Have on Hand -->
            <h2 id="products">Products to Have on Hand</h2>

            <p>Having the right products ready before your parents arrive means you will not have to make emergency shopping trips during the holiday. Here are the essentials we recommend based on the most common needs.</p>

            <p><strong>For the bathroom:</strong></p>
            <ul>
