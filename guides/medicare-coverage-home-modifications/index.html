            <p>Making your home safer often requires an investment in equipment, modifications, or professional installation. The good news is that several programs exist to help offset these costs. Understanding what each program covers, and what it does not, can help you make informed decisions and potentially save thousands of dollars.</p>

            <p>This guide walks you through the major funding sources available for home modifications: Medicare, Medicaid waiver programs, VA benefits for veterans, tax deductions, and state or local assistance programs. Each has different eligibility requirements and covered items, so knowing where to look is half the battle.</p>

              <p><strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> This guide is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial, legal, or medical advice. Coverage policies, benefit amounts, and eligibility requirements change frequently. Always verify current information directly with Medicare, your state Medicaid office, the VA, or a qualified professional before making decisions based on this guide.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Overview -->
            <h2 id="overview">What Medicare Does and Doesn't Cover</h2>

            <p>Medicare is the federal health insurance program primarily serving people aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities. Many people assume Medicare will help pay for home safety modifications, but the reality is more limited than most expect.</p>

            <p><strong>Traditional Medicare (Parts A and B) does not cover home modifications.</strong> This includes structural changes like grab bar installation, wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, roll-in showers, stair lifts, or bathroom renovations. These items are considered home improvements rather than medical treatment, so they fall outside Medicare's coverage scope.</p>

            <p>However, Medicare does cover certain portable medical equipment and supplies under Part B, which we will discuss in the next section. Additionally, Medicare covers some home health services when you meet specific criteria, including being homebound and needing skilled nursing care or therapy.</p>

            <p><strong>Medicare Advantage plans</strong> (Part C) are offered by private insurers and sometimes include benefits beyond traditional Medicare. Some Medicare Advantage plans now offer supplemental benefits for home safety, including allowances for grab bars, bathroom modifications, or home safety assessments. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, review your plan documents or call your insurer to ask specifically about home modification benefits.</p>

            <!-- DME Coverage -->
            <h2 id="dme">Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Coverage</h2>

            <p>While Medicare does not cover permanent home modifications, it does cover durable medical equipment (DME) under Part B when prescribed by a doctor and deemed medically necessary. DME refers to equipment that serves a medical purpose, can withstand repeated use, and is appropriate for home use.</p>

            <p><strong>Items that may be covered include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hospital beds for home use</li>
              <li>Patient lifts (such as Hoyer lifts)</li>
              <li>Wheelchairs and power mobility devices</li>
              <li>Walkers, canes, and crutches</li>
              <li>Commodes (portable toilet chairs)</li>
              <li>Certain seat lift mechanisms (the lift mechanism only, not the chair)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Items typically not covered include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shower chairs and bath benches (considered convenience items)</li>
              <li>Raised toilet seats</li>
              <li>Grab bars</li>
              <li>Stair lifts and home elevators</li>
              <li>Non-slip mats and flooring</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To receive DME coverage, you need a prescription from your doctor stating medical necessity. Medicare typically pays 80% of the approved amount after you meet your Part B deductible, and you pay the remaining 20%. You must obtain equipment from a Medicare-enrolled supplier. Using a non-enrolled supplier means Medicare will not pay, and you will be responsible for the full cost.</p>

            <!-- Home Health Coverage -->
            <h2 id="home-health">Home Health Aide Coverage</h2>

            <p>Medicare Part A and Part B cover home health services when you meet certain conditions. This is not the same as long-term home care, but it can provide valuable short-term support, especially after a hospital stay or when recovering from illness or injury.</p>

            <p><strong>To qualify for Medicare home health coverage, you must:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be homebound (leaving home requires considerable effort)</li>
              <li>Need skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy on an intermittent basis</li>
              <li>Have a doctor certify that you need home health care and create a plan of care</li>
              <li>Receive services from a Medicare-certified home health agency</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you qualify, Medicare covers skilled nursing visits, physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medical social services, and some home health aide services. Home health aides can assist with personal care like bathing and dressing, but only when you are also receiving skilled care.</p>

            <p>An occupational therapist visiting through home health can assess your home for safety hazards and recommend modifications. While Medicare will not pay for the modifications themselves, this professional assessment can help you prioritize improvements and may support applications for other funding sources.</p>

            <!-- Medicaid Waiver Programs -->
            <h2 id="medicaid">Medicaid Waiver Programs for Home Modifications</h2>

            <p>Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage to people with limited income and resources. Unlike Medicare, many state Medicaid programs do cover home modifications through Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver programs.</p>

            <p>HCBS waivers allow states to provide services that help people remain in their homes rather than moving to nursing facilities. These programs vary significantly by state, but many include home modifications as a covered service.</p>

            <p><strong>Modifications that may be covered through Medicaid waivers include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wheelchair ramps and accessible entryways</li>
              <li>Grab bars and handrails</li>
              <li>Widened doorways</li>
              <li>Roll-in showers and accessible bathrooms</li>
              <li>Stair lifts and platform lifts</li>
              <li>Accessible kitchen modifications</li>
              <li>Non-slip flooring</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Eligibility requirements typically include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Meeting your state's Medicaid income and asset limits</li>
              <li>Having a disability or condition that qualifies for the waiver program</li>
              <li>Demonstrating that home modifications would help you remain safely at home</li>
              <li>Completing an assessment by your state's Medicaid agency</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Many HCBS waiver programs have waiting lists, sometimes lasting months or even years, depending on your state and the specific waiver. Contact your state Medicaid office or Area Agency on Aging to learn about available programs, eligibility requirements, and current wait times in your area.</p>

            <!-- VA Benefits -->
            <h2 id="va-benefits">VA Benefits for Veterans</h2>

            <p>Veterans with service-connected disabilities may qualify for substantial grants to modify their homes. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers several programs specifically designed to help veterans live safely and independently.</p>

            <p><strong>Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant:</strong> This grant provides up to $117,014 (2026 amount) to help veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities build, purchase, or modify a home to meet their needs. Qualifying disabilities include loss or loss of use of both legs, loss or loss of use of both arms, blindness in both eyes, and certain severe burn injuries. This grant can fund major modifications like accessible bathrooms, widened doorways, ramps, and more.</p>

            <p><strong>Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) Grant:</strong> This grant provides up to $23,444 (2026 amount) for veterans with specific service-connected disabilities including blindness in both eyes, loss or loss of use of both hands, and certain respiratory injuries. The SHA grant can be used to modify an existing home or a home the veteran plans to purchase.</p>

            <p><strong>Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) Grant:</strong> This grant is available to veterans who need modifications for any disability, whether or not it is service-connected. Veterans with service-connected disabilities can receive up to $6,800, while those with non-service-connected disabilities can receive up to $2,000. HISA grants can cover grab bars, ramps, roll-in showers, and similar modifications.</p>

            <p><strong>Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) Grants:</strong> If a veteran is temporarily living in a family member's home, TRA grants can help modify that residence. The maximum amounts are lower than SAH and SHA grants but can still provide meaningful assistance.</p>

            <p>To apply for VA housing grants, contact your regional VA office or visit the VA's eBenefits portal. A VA caseworker can help determine which grants you may qualify for and guide you through the application process.</p>

            <!-- Tax Deductions -->
            <h2 id="tax-deductions">Tax Deductions for Medical Expenses</h2>

            <p>Home modifications made for medical purposes may qualify as deductible medical expenses on your federal income tax return. This will not provide immediate funding, but it can reduce your tax burden and effectively lower the net cost of modifications.</p>

            <p><strong>To qualify as a medical expense deduction, the modification must:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be made primarily for medical care (not for general home improvement)</li>
              <li>Be recommended by a physician for a specific medical condition</li>
              <li>Not significantly increase your home's value, or only the portion exceeding the value increase is deductible</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Examples of potentially deductible modifications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Entrance ramps for wheelchair access</li>
              <li>Widened doorways and hallways</li>
              <li>Grab bars and handrails</li>
              <li>Accessible bathroom modifications</li>
              <li>Lowered kitchen cabinets and countertops</li>
              <li>Stair lifts and home elevators</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key limitation is that medical expenses are only deductible to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). For example, if your AGI is $60,000, you can only deduct medical expenses exceeding $4,500. Keep detailed records of all expenses, including receipts, physician recommendations, and contractor invoices.</p>

            <p>Because tax laws are complex and change over time, consult a qualified tax professional or CPA to determine how medical expense deductions apply to your specific situation.</p>

            <!-- State and Local Programs -->
            <h2 id="state-local">State and Local Programs for Assistance</h2>

            <p>Beyond federal programs, many states, counties, and cities offer additional assistance for home modifications. These programs vary widely in availability, eligibility requirements, and funding levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Area Agencies on Aging (AAA):</strong> Every region in the United States has an Area Agency on Aging that can connect you with local resources. Many AAAs offer home modification programs, low-interest loans, or can refer you to organizations that do. To find your local AAA, visit the Eldercare Locator at eldercare.acl.gov or call 1-800-677-1116.</p>

            <p><strong>Community Development Block Grants (CDBG):</strong> Many cities and counties receive federal CDBG funding and use a portion for housing rehabilitation programs, including accessibility modifications for low-income residents. Contact your local housing authority or community development department to learn about available programs.</p>

            <p><strong>Nonprofit Organizations:</strong> Organizations like Rebuilding Together, Habitat for Humanity, and local independent living centers sometimes provide free or low-cost home modifications for seniors and people with disabilities. Eligibility often depends on income and the organization's current funding and volunteer availability.</p>

            <p><strong>State Housing Finance Agencies:</strong> Many states offer low-interest loans or grants specifically for home accessibility modifications. Some programs are targeted at seniors, others at people with disabilities, and some serve both populations. Your state housing finance agency's website is a good starting point for research.</p>

            <p><strong>Utility Company Programs:</strong> Some utility companies offer rebates or assistance for energy-efficient modifications that also improve accessibility, such as upgraded lighting or accessible thermostats. Check with your local utility providers about available programs.</p>

            <!-- Next Steps -->
            <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

            <p>Finding funding for home modifications often requires exploring multiple sources. Here is a practical approach to get started:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Identify your specific needs.</strong> Before applying for any program, understand exactly what modifications would help you most. Our <a href="/guides/bathroom-safety-checklist/">bathroom safety checklist</a> can help you assess one of the most important rooms in your home.</li>
              <li><strong>Check your current insurance.</strong> If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, call your insurer and ask specifically about home safety benefits. Review your policy documents for any supplemental benefits you may have overlooked.</li>
              <li><strong>Contact your Area Agency on Aging.</strong> Your local AAA can provide information about Medicaid waiver programs, state and local assistance programs, and nonprofit resources in your community. This single call often uncovers multiple options.</li>
              <li><strong>If you are a veteran, contact the VA.</strong> Speak with a VA caseworker about housing grant eligibility. Even if you do not qualify for SAH or SHA grants, the HISA program has broader eligibility.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep records for tax purposes.</strong> Even if you pay out of pocket for modifications, document everything. Get a letter from your physician explaining the medical necessity, save all receipts, and consult a tax professional about potential deductions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>While Medicare's coverage for home modifications is limited, other programs can help fill the gap. With patience and persistence, you may find that the home safety improvements you need are more affordable than you initially thought.</p>
